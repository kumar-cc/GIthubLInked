290,"Personal Details",1,PDA,"General Advice","Personal Statement","When you write a personal statement for a CV or application, your goal is to appeal to your prospective employer in a clear and  concise fashion.<br /><br />
It is essential that your personal statement doesn't include information about job history and achievements. These sections come later in your CV.<br /><br />
You should attempt to link any skills to how they would specifically benefit an organization. For example, a personal statement might  read something like this:<br /><br />
<em>""If you&#39;re seeking a Network Technician to improve the reliability and development of your company&#39;s server, my experience  in design, implementation and maintenance will prove invaluable. Troubleshooting and support come as second nature, meaning fewer and less  frequent connectivity issues for your large-scale network.""</em><br />
